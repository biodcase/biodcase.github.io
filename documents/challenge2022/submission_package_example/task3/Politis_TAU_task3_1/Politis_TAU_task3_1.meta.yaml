  # meta analysis of the submitted system. Use general level tags, if possible use the tags provided in comments.
  # If information field is not applicable to the system, use "!!null".
  description:

    # Audio input
    input_format: Ambisonic                  	# e.g. Ambisonic or Microphone Array or both
    input_sampling_rate: 24kHz          	#

    # Acoustic representation
    acoustic_features: mel spectra, intensity vector   # e.g one or multiple [phase and magnitude spectra, mel spectra, GCC-PHAT, TDOA, intensity vector ...]

    # Data augmentation methods
    data_augmentation: !!null             	# [time stretching, block mixing, pitch shifting, ...]

    # Machine learning
    # In case of using ensemble methods, please specify all methods used (comma separated list).
    machine_learning_method: CRNN          	# e.g one or multiple [GMM, HMM, SVM, kNN, MLP, CNN, RNN, CRNN, NMF, random forest, ensemble, ...]


  # System complexity, meta data provided here will be used to evaluate
  # submitted systems from the computational load perspective.
  complexity:

    # Total amount of parameters used in the acoustic model. For neural networks, this
    # information is usually given before training process in the network summary.
    # For other than neural networks, if parameter count information is not directly available,
    # try estimating the count as accurately as possible.
    # In case of ensemble approaches, add up parameters for all subsystems.
